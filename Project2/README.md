# Mini-project 2 for EPFL EE-559-Deep Learning 2020

## Abstract
 Using a limited portion of PyTorch's tensors operations, the goal of this project is to develop a deep learning framework allowing users to simply define, optimize and test neural network models while leveraging the computational complexity. 

## File structure
```
│   activations.py - Module containing implementations of activation functions
│   actual_result.png - Plot visualizing cross-validation results for various hyperparameters
                        and model combinations generated by the framework
│   criteria.py - Module containing implementations of loss functions
│   cross_validate.py - Module providing implementation of SGD and Adam optimization parameter cross-validation
│   models.py - Module containing implementations of layers and model architectures
│   plot.py - Module containing implementations of functions for generating the desired plots
|   report.pdf - Detailed project report
|   requirements.txt - File containing the python packages required to run the project
│   test.py - Module containing the main code of the project
              The goal is to build and run a mini deep learning framework on a simple 2D binary classification problem
              Here we provide the implementation of the default required model definition and training procedure
              using our framework and we also optionally demonstrate the optional provided functionalities
              such as cross validation and multiple extra modules such as different activation and loss functions
              and a different optimization algorithm and parameters
│   train.py - Module providing implementations of the SGD and Adam optimization algorithms as well as model evaluation
```

## Run the code
To run the demo code, from the root folder of the project run `python3 test.py`.

### Dependencies
- Python 3.7
- `torch 1.5.0` - PyTorch deep learning framework, used only for tensor operations
- `pandas 1.0.3` - Data manipulation library, used only for post-processing the cross-validation results to be used for plotting
- `matplotlib 3.1.1` and `seaborn 0.10.1` - Plotting libraries, used only for plot configuration and generation 

All dependencies can be installed easily by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
